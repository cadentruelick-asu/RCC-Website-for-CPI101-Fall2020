				<p>I have enjoyed golf my entire life. Before my freshman year of high

				played competitively on numerous junior golf tours, on my high school
				team, and the ASU Karsten and Ken McDonald Junior Interclub Teams. I
				qualifed for and played in my first professional event in Summer 2020 
				and hope to continue to play amateur and professional events throughout 
				college and beyond.</p>

				the Jr. Home Run Derby, falling just short of nationals.</p>
