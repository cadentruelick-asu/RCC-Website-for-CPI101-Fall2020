		<h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
		<p>I started my freshman year at Arizona State University in Fall 2020. 
		I'm an Informatics Major at the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. My
		love for computer science began in high school when I took my first
		programming course. I went on to take the second year of the course Senior
		year and have loved it ever since. In May 2020, I successfully became 
		recognized as a Microsoft Technology Assosciate for "Introduction to 
		Programming using Java". I am eager to continue learning and perfecting
		my skills. To view my resume, <a href="resume.html">click here</a> or in the navigation bar.</p>
